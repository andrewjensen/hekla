A pluggable static code analysis toolset for understanding large Javascript projects

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start using Hekla is through the [CLI tool](tree/master/packages/hekla-cli). You can also install and use the [core analysis](tree/master/packages/hekla-core) and [viewer](tree/master/packages/hekla-viewer) packages directly.
